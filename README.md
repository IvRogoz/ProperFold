# Proper VS Code Folding

## Features

ProperFold is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to simplify code navigation by automatically folding the outermost curly brackets {} in your code. This targeted folding allows developers to focus on the broader structure of their projects without the distraction of nested code details. ProperFold is ideal for languages that use curly braces for scoping, such as JavaScript, TypeScript, C++, C#, and others.

This plugin was made as no other plugin is ignoring multiline comments. 
THIS PLUGIN IGNORES multiline comments and DOES NOT fold them.
